# Decentralized Prediction Market for Climate Change Mitigation

## Overview
The **Decentralized Prediction Market for Climate Change Mitigation** is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and trade prediction markets related to climate change outcomes and mitigation efforts. It leverages smart contracts for secure and transparent market operations, ensuring accurate resolution based on verified data sources.

## Features
- **Prediction Market Platform**:
    - Users can create and participate in prediction markets related to climate change trends.
    - Market outcomes are resolved based on trusted scientific data sources.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - **Market Creation**: Users can create prediction markets with predefined conditions.
    - **Trading Mechanism**: Decentralized trading of prediction shares.
    - **Resolution Mechanism**: Market outcomes determined by verified climate data.
- **NFT Integration**:
    - **Prediction Representation**: Significant predictions are represented as NFTs.
    - **Contribution Recognition**: Key contributions to climate change understanding are tokenized.
- **Climate Data Integration**:
    - Partners with climate data providers and scientific institutions for accurate market resolution.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solana, or Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity, Clarity
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage
- **NFTs**: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for market-based contributions
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain metadata

## How It Works
1. **Market Creation**:
    - Users create climate-related prediction markets.
    - Smart contracts define market parameters.
2. **Trading & Participation**:
    - Participants trade shares based on expected outcomes.
    - Market liquidity is maintained through decentralized mechanisms.
3. **Resolution & Payouts**:
    - Outcomes are verified using trusted climate data sources.
    - Payouts are executed based on smart contract logic.
4. **NFT Recognition**:
    - Users making significant predictions receive NFTs.
    - Contributions to climate research are rewarded.
